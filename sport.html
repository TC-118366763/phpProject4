        <p style="color:white;"> Sport has always been my favourite hobby. Whether it's been watching it on tv or participating in the sport itself, it has always played a significant role in my life.</p>

        <p style="color:white;">Soccer is a real passion of mine. From the day I could stand on both feet I was kicking a ball. At six years old, I joined the local club, Mayfield United AFC.
            It was an instant obsession. After a little convincing from my grand-father, I decided to support Arsenal, despite my Dad's keen interest with Manchester United. Pretty soon I had the jerseys, the training tops and even the official club socks. 
            I played with Mayfield from the under-8s all the way along to the Youth team, with a brief stint with Leeside AFC in 2017 where I was part of an All-Ireland winning side. Unfortunately, I never enjoyed the same success with Mayfield, having lost two Cork finals in 2014 and 2018.
            I did not register for any club at the beginning of this year's season, but still enjoy a casual 7-a-side with my friends.
            Although being an Arsenal fan can be tough at times, I have stuck by them and with the new manager in charge I have good hope for the future.</p>

            <p style="color:white;">Besides soccer, I have not played any other sport with a club. I made a few appearances with my school GAA team but it was not something I enjoyed.
                I do however get my daily dose of exercise, cycling to and from college.</p>
