        <p style="color: white;"> I love travelling. With family living in France, I am lucky enough to travel there every summer to visit them. Over the 19 years of my life, we have travelled to every corner of France and I always enjoy discovering new regions and towns. The food is delicious and the weather is always nice.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">I have also had brief holidays in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. When visiting these countries I have always been travelling with my family, which is enjoyable but can be sometimes boring That's why my trip to Palma de Mallorca in the summer of 2018 was so much fun. Myself and seven friends spent 10 days in Magaluf. It was an unforgettable experience and I have very fond memories from that holiday. 
This summer, I am travelling to the island of Ios in Greece with a big group of friends. Having heard of other people's experience and seen many pictures, I am really looking forward to it.
In future, I would like to venture outside of Europe, with South America and Australia at the top of my wish-list.</p>
