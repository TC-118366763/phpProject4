            <h4 style="color:blue; font-family:verdana">1. Blockchain</h4>
            <p>A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p>
            <p>So, what is so special about it and why are we saying that it has industry disrupting capabilities?</p>

            The blockchain network has no central authority — it is the very definition of a democratized system. Since it is a shared and immutable ledger, the information in it is open for anyone and everyone to see. Hence, anything that is built on the blockchain is by its very nature transparent and everyone involved is accountable for their actions.

            <h4 style="color:blue; font-family:verdana">2. Autonomous Things</h4>
            <p> Autonomous things, abbreviated AuT, or the Internet of autonomous things, abbreviated as IoAT, is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects.

                Self-navigating drones are the first AuT technology in (limited) deployment. It is expected that the first mass-deployment of AuT technologies will be the autonomous car, generally expected to be available around 2020. Other currently expected AuT technologies include home robotics (e.g., machines that provide care for the elderly, infirm or young), and military robots (air, land or sea autonomous machines with information-collection or target-attack capabilities)</p>

            <p>
                Immersive technologies such as virtual and augmented reality are currently taking the world by storm. Over the past three years, we’ve seen a huge interest in immersive technologies from the likes of advertising agencies, games developers, construction companies and more…</p>

            <p>Immersive technology is not a new concept. Experimentation with virtual and augmented reality has been taking place since the 1960s, hidden inside research facilities across the world. The Sword of Damocles is considered by most to be one of the first virtual reality headsets. Built by Ivan Southerland and Bob Sproull in a laboratory at MIT, it was a large and somewhat dystopian looking device. The device was so heavy that it had to mounted to a mechanical arm attached to the ceiling when in use.</p>

            <p>When using the device, the users would be able to see a virtual environment, but since graphics technology was not very advanced, these were usually just simple wireframe rooms.
            </p>
            
            <p>Immersive technology was further popularised by Star Trek’s Holodeck. In the hit sci-fi tv show, characters could enter a specific room and it would create an expansive virtual world that was so in-depth, it was almost identical to reality. Lots of people were excited by the thought that, one day, in the distant future, we may be able to recreate whole worlds inside a holodeck.</p>
